# Questions and answers for the first meeting with fusion lab team.

### Where would this event happen? Is there space for participants to cheer each other on, etc.?

The feature gym in CoRec would be a preferred location. The open space, for example, Krach lawn, also possible. However, open locations are subjected the the weather. In any cases, there is space for spectators to cheer on.

### Is there a way to incentivize student participation? Participants in BGR are grouped into “hall teams” based on residences; could teams compete (perhaps by having students in different halls “add” to hall team totals, rather than individual totals)?

We can setup a leader board to encourage students to represent their teams/halls. At this current phase, the challenge will be a single player game. However, we can modify the scoring system to incentive multiple students to participate as a team. 

### Can the rabbit and/or scarecrow have different hall team themed avatars?

We can accept a team logo/flag on the leader board.
